# DS542-AI-powered-storyboard-generator

Overview:
The project proposes an AI-powered storyboard generator that transforms written prompts or scripts into frame-by-frame illustrated storyboards, simulating the creative workflow of a human storyboard artist. By integrating prompt-based diffusion models, captioning systems, vision-based panel extraction, and a multi-agent AI pipeline, we aim to automate and streamline the traditionally labor-intensive process of storyboard creation.

The system is designed for filmmakers, animators, and comic creators who want to visualize scenes rapidly and consistently, without needing advanced artistic skills.

Key Components:
1. Data Preprocessing & Frame Segmentation
Uses object detection models (e.g., YOLO, Detectron2) to extract individual frames from visual material.

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tools such as Tesseract help extract dialogues, scene text, or descriptions embedded within panels.

Additional steps like style transfer or edge-based segmentation enhance clarity and artistic uniformity.

2. Scene Description Generation
State-of-the-art captioning models (e.g., BLIP-2, Flamingo) generate contextual descriptions for each frame or image.

Descriptions are fine-tuned to capture character actions, scene backgrounds, and emotional cues for richer storytelling.

3. Diffusion-Based Image Generation
Fine-tunes models like Stable Diffusion or DALL·E-3 to generate coherent visual scenes from frame descriptions.

Employs LoRA fine-tuning and Latent Consistency Models (LCM) to ensure stylistic and narrative consistency between frames.

4. Agent-Based Narrative Coherence
A large language model (LLM) such as GPT-4 decomposes user inputs into structured sequences of frame-level prompts.

Each frame is generated in context-aware fashion, preserving character positions, emotional tones, and environment continuity.

Cosine similarity and visual matching metrics are used to validate and refine transitions between frames.

5. Interactive Web Interface
Built using Gradio or Streamlit, allowing users to:

Input a story idea or script

Preview storyboard panels in real-time

Download final outputs as images or PDFs

Evaluation Metrics:
Narrative Coherence: Reviewed by experts in animation and filmmaking.

Visual Consistency: Measured using SSIM and cosine similarity across adjacent frames.

Image Quality: Evaluated via FID (Fréchet Inception Distance) and Inception Score.

User Feedback: Collected through surveys targeting writers, artists, and UI/UX designers.

Vision:
By blending powerful generative AI with structured narrative logic, this project unlocks fast, creative, and accessible storyboard creation. Whether for a short film, webtoon, or game cutscene, our system allows creators to visualize stories with minimal manual input—preserving artistic value while saving time.
